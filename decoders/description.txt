The decoders have been designed in gate-level modeeling. 
The top modules are created to interface the design with the board I/O.
The testbenches are utilized to verify the design. 
The 2 to 4 decoder has enable and 2 bit variable as inputs and corresponding 4 bits as the output.
The 3 to 8 decoder is designed using two 2 to 4 decoders, the enable signal as used as the third input.
The 4 to 16 decoder is designed using five 2 to 4 decoders.
